  # {title}

  Vierin Dental Office was one of my first clients, whose necessity was to advertise
  online via an internet website. In order to fullfill the client's needs, I decided
  to group all the informations in a single page, to simplify the user experience.

  ## Visual Design

  The palette chosen for the project is a group of 10 shades of a bluish-gray, to give
  an elegant monochromatic style. Lighter shades are used in backgrounds, darker shades
  are applied to text and icons.

  The fonts chosen are [Nunito](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/nunito) and
  [Nunito Sans](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/nunito-sans): the first is used for the
  headings, the latter for paragraphs. Theyâ€™re two versions of the same typeface, one is
  a rounded terminal sans serif and the secondo is a non-rounded terminal. Theyâ€™re designed
  for display typography and came out as the perfect choice for this project. The font
  weight **bold** is used for the headings, and the text is always left-aligned.

  All the photos have been adjusted in cool tones matching the palette. For each service
  that the Clinic offers there is a customized animated icon; they add a little bit of
  expressiveness and playfulness.

  ## Information Architecture

  The homepage is divided in three major sections:

  - **Hero Section**: Contains the logo of the Dental Office (I designed it myself ðŸ«£) and a
  group photo of the entire Dental Office. On top lies the navigation menu.
  - **Team Section**: A detail of every employee of the Office. The section can be scrolled
  horizontally.
  - **Services**: Displayed in a grid, there are severald cards containing a detailed
  description of the services offered and a custom animated icon.


  ## Wireframing

  This is the initial structure of the whole design.

  ## Prototyping

  These are the last figma sketches shown to the customer, right before developing it with the
  Full-Stack Developer Iâ€™m working with.


  ## Mobile Design

  According to [Don't Make Me Think](https://www.amazon.it/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758),
  on the mobile version of the website there is a floating button in the lower right corner,
  always visible on screen, which allows the user to easily call the Dental Office in case of
  an emergency.
